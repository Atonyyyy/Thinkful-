What are the three longest trips on rainy days?
WITH 
	rainy
AS (
	SELECT
		zip
	FROM
		weather
	WHERE
		events= 'Rain'
GROUP BY 1
)
	SELECT
		trips.trip_id,
		trips.duration,
		trips.zip_code
	FROM
	trips
	JOIN 
	rainy
	ON trips.zip_code = rainy.zip
	ORDER BY duration DESC
LIMIT 3

Which station is full most often?
SELECT
	stations.station_id,
	stations.name,
	status.station_id,
	status.docks_available
	
FROM
	status
JOIN
	stations
ON
	stations.station_id = status.station_id
GROUP BY 1,2,3,4
ORDER BY docks_available ASC

Return a list of stations with a count of number of trips starting at that station but ordered by dock count.
SELECT
	stations.name,
	stations.dockcount,
	COUNT(*)
FROM
	stations
JOIN
	trips
ON
	stations.name = trips.start_station
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY dockcount DESC

(Challenge) What's the length of the longest trip for each day it rains anywhere?
WITH rainy as 
(
SELECT

From weather
WHERE events = 'Rain'
GROUP BY 1
) 
SELECT 
duration,
DATE(start_date) start_date1
FROM
trips
JOIN
rainy
ON
DATE(trips.start_date) = DATE(rainy.rain_date)
GROUP by 1,2
ORDER BY duration DESC
